# Project 3_0: Getting Input
This assignment will have you practice how to read input from a joystick and print it to the SmartDashboard.

***Pre-req:***

- Must have set up your environment in [Project 0_1](https://classroom.github.com/a/d-9tQmrq)
- You can use the same WPILib robot project you created in [Project 0_2](https://classroom.github.com/a/Uk8lrES1)

## ***Robot Code Requirements***

- Create [`XboxControllerâ€‹`](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/joystick.html?highlight=xboxcontroller#xboxcontroller-class) object called `mainController` in RobotContainer.java
	- [More](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2022-RapidReact/blob/main/src/main/java/team3647/lib/inputs/Joysticks.java) on how to use XboxController
